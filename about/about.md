Mathematically I have an interest in Foundations and Functional Analysis. I enjoy Foundations in various shapes and guises not limited to but including Model Theory, Set Theory and Category Theory. On the Analytic front, I am interested in generally large structures and what phenomena they exhibit. I am working on an essay on 'Coarse Geometry in Banach Spaces' under Dr Andras Zsak, Peterhouse, University of Cambridge.

Outside of mathematics, I have a keen interest in literature and music. I try to read widely and broadly but ultimately end up reading the classics and weird/postmodern/sci fiction. Again with music, I percieve myself as having an eclectic taste but it mainly stems from /r/trap. Artists I've been enjoying recently are: Juelz, ISOxo, Iglooghost, Blank Banshee and Porter Robinson.
